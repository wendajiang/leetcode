 * Note: This is a companion problem to the System Design problem: Design
 * TinyURL.
 * 
 * TinyURL is a URL shortening service where you enter a URL such as
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/design-tinyurl and it returns a short URL such
 * as http://tinyurl.com/4e9iAk.
 * 
 * Design the encode and decode methods for the TinyURL service. There is no
 * restriction on how your encode/decode algorithm should work. You just need
 * to ensure that a URL can be encoded to a tiny URL and the tiny URL can be
 * decoded to the original URL.
