 * Testcase Example:  '[4,5,1,9]\n5'
 *
 * Write a function to delete a node in a singly-linked list. You will not be
 * given access to the head of the list, instead you will be given access to
 * the node to be deleted directly.
 *
 * It is guaranteed that the node to be deleted is not a tail node in the
 * list.
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 *
 * Input: head = [4,5,1,9], node = 5
 * Output: [4,1,9]
 * Explanation: You are given the second node with value 5, the linked list
 * should become 4 -> 1 -> 9 after calling your function.
 *
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 *
 * Input: head = [4,5,1,9], node = 1
 * Output: [4,5,9]
 * Explanation: You are given the third node with value 1, the linked list
 * should become 4 -> 5 -> 9 after calling your function.
 *
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 *
 * The number of the nodes in the given list is in the range [2, 1000].
 * -1000 <= Node.val <= 1000
 * The value of each node in the list is unique.
 * The node to be deleted is in the list and is not a tail node
