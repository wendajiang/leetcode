# house robber 问题三个
## 1. 198
0 houses return 0.

1 house returns num[0].

2 houses return whichever larger.

For n houses where n > 2:

Consider the last house num[n-1]. It is either robbed, or NOT robbed.

If robbed, then amount of money is (total of n-2 houses) + num[n-1].

If NOT robbed, then amount of money is (total of n-1 houses).

Return whichever larger.

**Here is the DP formula that leads to the right answer:**

M(k) = money at the kth house
P(0) = 0
P(1) = M(1)
P(k) = max(P(k−2) + M(k), P(k−1))

## 2. 213 最后一个房子和第一个房子算成相连的，就是构成一个环，仍然不能rob相连的两栋房子
使用198问题解法里的函数
对0 - (size - 2)
和1 - (size - 1)两个数组调用选largger的那个
