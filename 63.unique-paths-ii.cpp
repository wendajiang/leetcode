 *
 * A robot is located at the top-left corner of a m x n grid (marked 'Start' in
 * the diagram below).
 *
 * The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time. The robot
 * is trying to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid (marked 'Finish' in
 * the diagram below).
 *
 * Now consider if some obstacles are added to the grids. How many unique paths
 * would there be?
 *
 *
 *
 * An obstacle and empty space is marked as 1 and 0 respectively in the grid.
 *
 * Note: m and n will be at most 100.
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 *
 * Input:
 * [
 * [0,0,0],
 * [0,1,0],
 * [0,0,0]
 * ]
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation:
 * There is one obstacle in the middle of the 3x3 grid above.
 * There are two ways to reach the bottom-right corner:
 * 1. Right -> Right -> Down -> Down
 * 2. Down -> Down -> Right -> Right
 *
