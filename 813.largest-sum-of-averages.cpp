 *
 * We partition a row of numbers AÂ into at most K adjacent (non-empty) groups,
 * then our score is the sum of the average of each group. What is the largest
 * score we can achieve?
 *
 * Note that our partition must use every number in A, and that scores are not
 * necessarily integers.
 *
 *
 * Example:
 * Input:
 * A = [9,1,2,3,9]
 * K = 3
 * Output: 20
 * Explanation:
 * The best choice is to partition A into [9], [1, 2, 3], [9]. The answer is 9
 * + (1 + 2 + 3) / 3 + 9 = 20.
 * We could have also partitioned A into [9, 1], [2], [3, 9], for example.
 * That partition would lead to a score of 5 + 2 + 6 = 13, which is worse.
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * Note:
 *
 *
 * 1 <= A.length <= 100.
 * 1 <= A[i] <= 10000.
 * 1 <= K <= A.length.
 * Answers within 10^-6 of the correct answer will be accepted as correct.
