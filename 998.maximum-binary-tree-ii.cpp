 *
 * A maximum tree is a tree where every node has a value greater than any other
 * value in its subtree.
 *
 * You are given the root of a maximum binary tree and an integer val.
 *
 * Just as in the previous problem, the given tree was constructed from a list
 * a (root = Construct(a)) recursively with the following Construct(a)
 * routine:
 *
 *
 * If a is empty, return null.
 * Otherwise, let a[i] be the largest element of a. Create a root node with the
 * value a[i].
 * The left child of root will be Construct([a[0], a[1], ..., a[i - 1]]).
 * The right child of root will be Construct([a[i + 1], a[i + 2], ...,
 * a[a.length - 1]]).
 * Return root.
 *
 *
 * Note that we were not given a directly, only a root node root =
 * Construct(a).
 *
 * Suppose b is a copy of a with the value val appended to it. It is guaranteed
 * that b has unique values.
 *
 * Return Construct(b).
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 *
 * Input: root = [4,1,3,null,null,2], val = 5
 * Output: [5,4,null,1,3,null,null,2]
 * Explanation: a = [1,4,2,3], b = [1,4,2,3,5]
 *
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 *
 * Input: root = [5,2,4,null,1], val = 3
 * Output: [5,2,4,null,1,null,3]
 * Explanation: a = [2,1,5,4], b = [2,1,5,4,3]
 *
 *
 * Example 3:
 *
 *
 * Input: root = [5,2,3,null,1], val = 4
 * Output: [5,2,4,null,1,3]
 * Explanation: a = [2,1,5,3], b = [2,1,5,3,4]
 *
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 *
 * The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 100].
 * 1 <= Node.val <= 100
 * All the values of the tree are unique.
 * 1 <= val <= 100
 *
